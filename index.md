Literally 1984

This repository has been an...enlightening experience. Apparently GitHub doesn't bother verifying commits unless you sign them (which is reasonable, actually) and git doesn't have amazing support for multiple user accounts (also reasonable, actually).

I sure hope this doesn't cause any problems down the line.
